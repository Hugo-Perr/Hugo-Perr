## Hi, I'm Hugo Perier ðŸ‘‹

A data scientist with a passion for unraveling insights through neural networks (especially OCR algorithms) and crafting compelling data visualizations. I truly believe that a well-designed visual can make even the most complex data accessible, and as a visual learner myself, I experience that firsthand!

Here's a peek at what you'll find on my GitHub:

- ðŸ“‚ I only share some undergraduate or private projects (if they are well documented) here for privacy reasons
- ðŸ§  Never stop learning: I love tackling LeetCode challenges. You might find some of my solutions [here](https://github.com/Hugo-Perr/Leetcode-prep).
- âœ¨ Fun fact: it was during my semester abroad at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) that I realised my true calling was in the field of data science.
